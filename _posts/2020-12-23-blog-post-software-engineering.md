This document focuses on the development cycle of a software system dedicated to those who manage or intend to start managing: a call center, telemarketing activity, appointment booking, telephone operators, or in-house activity within their own company. It will analyze the tools and systems that will enable maximum efficiency, both in the number of calls made and completed sales. **The discussion will focus on the functions and definitions that can facilitate the daily work of administrators, system administrators, switchboard operators, sales agents, and their interaction.**

# üí° Our Idea
The name of our call center management software system is IOCaller Software System (aiok√¥l…ôr), where IO stands for "**Inbound and Outbound**", indicating the two classifications of switchboard operators. Below is a proposed logo for the software system in question.

### Project Overview
# Solution to the Problem (Complete Package Class Diagram)

The realization of the Complete Package Diagram was obtained starting from the identification in the design sequences of the following classes:
- *ConsoleBoundary Class*
- *Controller and ControllerImpl Classes*
- *Entity Class*
- *DAO (Database Interaction) Class*

# From Class Diagram Package to Software Implementation
We show the hierarchy of the implemented Software interfaces, (we obviously invite the reader that this graph is the result of a complete implementation present in the repository)
